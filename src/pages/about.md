I am a designer turned developer with a penchant for front-end development and site building. I began using Drupal in 2011 and have been an evangelist for it ever since. I’ve spoken at various Drupal camps, helped organize a few, and have attended DrupalCon each year since 2012. I’ve recently increased my scope and am also working on projects using React.js and Gatsby.js.

When I’m not making websites, I like to bike around the city, play various musical instruments, research urban history, and spend time with my partner and our doggo.
