I am a designer turned developer with a penchant for front-end development and site building. I began using Drupal in 2011 and have been an evangelist for it ever since. I’ve spoken at various Drupal Camps, helped organize a few, and have attended DrupalCon each year since 2012.

More recently, I’ve increased my scope and am also working on projects using React.js and Gatsby.js — and am loving both.

I currently manage a nine-person team of developers and designers at The Ohio State University. Together, we are responsible for a portfolio websites and applications, a Drupal site building service, and all aspects of visual design for the Offices of the Chief Information Officer.

When I’m not making websites, I like to bike around the city, play various musical instruments, study urban history, and spend time with my partner and our doggo.
