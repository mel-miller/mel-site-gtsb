I am a designer turned full-stack developer with a specialization in front-end development, site theming, and design system development. 

I began developing for Drupal in 2011 and have been an evangelist for it ever since. I’ve spoken at various Drupal camps, helped organize a few, and have attended DrupalCon consistently since 2012.

While Drupal has historically been my primary development framework, I am always excited to dig into new technologies. I have spent the past few years working increasingly more and more in the JavaScript application space with React and React-based frameworks such as Gatsby and Docusaurus. I also have extensive experience building component-based design systems.

When I’m not making websites, I like to bike around the city, play various musical instruments (most recently on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0Pb37ITfck6eATunsfOgus" target="_blank">this album</a>), research urban history, <a href="https://melissamiller.photoshelter.com" target="_blank">take photos</a>, and spend time with my partner and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrsbeagleface/" target="_blank">our dog</a>.
